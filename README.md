# GUI-MoveObject
Using GUI to create moving object that increases speed when it is increased by 5

    Write a Java program that moves an image (an Image object only) around the screen randomly.
    If the user presses the mouse on the image, increment a score showing in the corner of the screen.
    If the user reaches a score of 5, make the image move faster so that it is more difficult to catch.
    If the user reaches a score of 10 make the image smaller or make it move even faster.
    Create a menu that allows the user to choose between three different images.
    Again this is an Image object only.
    The entire image must always be displayed on the screen.
